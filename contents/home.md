#### <strong>Welcome</strong>

I am currently a master's student in the School of Earth and Space Science of Peking University, with a major in Geochemistry, particularly in isotope and experimentally perspective, working with Yang Li and Xi Liu. I got mt bachelor degree in geology from the China University of Geosciences in Beijing, working on high pressure mineral physics, under supervision of Li Zhang.

I am working on in micro-spatial in situ isotope analysis and infrared spectroscopy. My research involves: (1) Exploring the basic principles of infrared spectroscopy in anisotropic crystal, which has been controversial for decades. (2) Establishing a new quartz reference material for oxygen and silicon. We get a huge pure synthetic sample from the NDK company, which was created for microprocessors. (3) Developing a new Ion Microprobe reduction software for geochronology and stable isotopes. (4) Developing the coupled K-Ca and Rb-Sr chronology in muscovite via Ion Microprobe. I am incorporated in the study of Change'6 returned sample.

Outside of research, I enjoy science fictions and imagining in my spare times, a crazy fan of Asimov, particularly his series "Galactic Empire", "Foundation" and "Robots". I am a rider and get a air dynamic road bike, I go Waltz dancing every two weeks as well. As a teenager boy, I do play video games, especially FPS, like the Overwatch.




#### <strong>News</strong>
Oct 17, 2025: Tony and Zhuoran find great agreement between our new infrared absorption model and the measured spectra, which makes us extremely excited. We are infinitely closed to resolve a long-standing debate!
Sep 16, 2025: Zhuoran attend the 1st Geochronology Summer School in China as a student assistant for Prof. Pieter Vermeesch.
