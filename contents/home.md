### <strong>Welcome :)</strong>

I am currently a master's student in the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University, majoring in Geochemistry with a focus on experimental and isotope geochemistry. I work with Dr. [Li Zhang](https://scholar.cugb.edu.cn/scholar/scholarDetail/2593.shtml) (primary advisor), Dr. [Xi Liu](https://sess.pku.edu.cn/info/1153/1915.htm), and Dr. [Yang Li](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/liy). Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Geology from the China University of Geosciences, where I conducted research in high-pressure mineral physics and spectroscopy.

My current research includes:
(1) Investigating the physical and chemical properties of Phase A (ongoing).  
(2) Exploring the fundamental principles of infrared spectroscopy in anisotropic crystals for quantifying volatiles (completed)).  
(3) Establishing a new quartz reference material for oxygen and silicon isotopes, based on an ultra-pure synthetic crystal provided by NDK, originally produced for microprocessor applications (in progress).  
(3) Developing new ion microprobe data reduction software for geochronology and stable isotope analysis (team project).  
(5) Advancing coupled K–Ca and Rb–Sr chronometry in muscovite using ion microprobe techniques (awaiting corresponding SIMS ion source).  
I am also involved in the study of the Chang'e-6 returned samples. I have a strong interest in numerical methods, including machine learning and DFT calculations, though my current experience with them is limited.

Outside of research, I enjoy science fiction and daydreaming in my spare time — I love the moments when my imagination runs free. I'm a huge fan of Isaac Asimov, particularly his *Galactic Empire*, *Foundation*, and *Robot* series. I'm also a cyclist with an aerodynamic road bike, and I practice modern dance every two weeks.

Tony and I found excellent agreement between our new infrared absorption model and the measured spectra, which makes us very excited. We are getting extremely close to resolving a long-standing debate!

I participated in the 1st Geochronology Summer School in China as an assistant to Prof. Pieter Vermeesch.
