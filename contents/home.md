#### <strong>Welcome :)</strong>

I am currently a master's student in the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University, majoring in Geochemistry with a focus on isotope/experimental geochemistry. I work with Dr. Yang Li and Dr. Xi Liu. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Geology from the China University of Geosciences (Beijing), where I worked on high-pressure mineral physics under the supervision of Dr. Li Zhang.

I am working on micro-spatial in situ isotope analysis and infrared spectroscopy.
My research involves:
(1) Exploring the fundamental principles of infrared spectroscopy in anisotropic crystals, which have been debated for decades.
(2) Establishing a new quartz reference material for oxygen and silicon isotopes, based on an ultra-pure synthetic crystal provided by NDK, originally produced for microprocessor applications.
(3) Developing new ion microprobe data reduction software for geochronology and stable isotope analysis.
(4) Advancing coupled K–Ca and Rb–Sr chronometry in muscovite using ion microprobe techniques.
I am also involved in the study of the Chang'e-6 returned samples.

Outside of research, I enjoy science fiction and daydreaming in my spare time. I'm a huge fan of Isaac Asimov, particularly his *Galactic Empire*, *Foundation*, and *Robot* series. I'm also a cyclist with an aerodynamic road bike, and I go waltz dancing every two weeks. Like many who grew up in my generation, I enjoy video games as well — especially first-person shooters such as Overwatch.

#### <strong>News</strong>
#### *Oct 17, 2025*<br>
Tony and I found excellent agreement between our new infrared absorption model and the measured spectra, which makes us very excited. We are getting extremely close to resolving a long-standing debate!

I participated in the 1st Geochronology Summer School in China as a student assistant to Prof. Pieter Vermeesch.
